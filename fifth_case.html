        <p>
            Physical health refers to the state of well-being where an individualâ€™s body functions optimally and is free from disease or dysfunction. It encompasses various aspects including the efficiency of bodily systems, physical fitness, and the absence of chronic illnesses. Good physical health is characterized by a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and effective stress management. It also involves maintaining a healthy weight, proper hydration, and a strong immune system.
