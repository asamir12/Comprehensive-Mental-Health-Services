            </h2>
            <p>
                ____Bullying is a repeated aggressive behavior intended to intimidate, dominate, or harm another person. It manifests in various forms, including physical, verbal, and relational aggression. Physical bullying involves hitting, pushing, or damaging someone's property. 
                Verbal bullying includes name-calling, insults, and threats. Relational bullying involves sabotaging relationships or spreading rumors to isolate the victim. The primary characteristic of bullying is an imbalance of power, where the aggressor seeks to control or harm the victim repeatedly over time.

                    <p>
                        Bullies may have underlying psychological issues such as low self-esteem, a need for control, or past trauma. They might use bullying as a way to cope with their insecurities or exert power over others.

                    <p>
                        Exposure to violence, abuse, or neglect within the family can contribute to bullying behavior. Children who witness or experience aggression at home may model these behaviors in their interactions with peers.

                    <p>
                        Societal norms and cultural attitudes can perpetuate bullying. Environments that glorify aggression or value dominance can foster bullying behavior. Peer pressure and the desire for social acceptance can also play significant roles.

                        Certain personality traits, such as a high need for dominance or aggression, can predispose individuals to bully others. Lack of empathy and difficulty understanding the impact of their actions on others are also contributing factors.

                    <p>
                        Inadequate supervision or poor management in schools, workplaces, or communities can create environments where bullying is more likely to occur. Systems that fail to address or penalize bullying behavior can exacerbate the problem.
