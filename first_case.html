                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p class="pragraf">
                ____Stress depression, often referred to as "depression due to stress," is a psychological condition in which 
                prolonged exposure to stress leads to the development of depressive symptoms. It involves a complex interplay between stress, which is a natural response to external pressures, and depression, which is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and impaired daily functioning.

                Understanding Stress Depression
            </h2>
            <p class="pragraf">
                ____Stress: Stress is the body's response to challenging or threatening situations, known as stressors. Stressors can be external (work pressure, financial issues, relationship problems) or internal (perfectionism, negative self-talk). When stress becomes chronic, it can overwhelm the body and mind, leading to physical, emotional, and behavioral issues.
                Depression: Depression is a mood disorder that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. Unlike occasional sadness, depression is persistent and can significantly impair one’s ability to function. Symptoms include feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, changes in sleep and appetite, and in severe cases, thoughts of suicide.
                Stress Depression: When stress is unrelenting and not managed effectively, it can trigger or exacerbate depression. This condition is particularly concerning because it can lead to a vicious cycle where stress leads to depression, and depression increases the perception of stress, creating a debilitating loop.

                Causes of Stress Depression
            </h2>
            <p class="pragraf">
                ____Chronic Stress: Long-term exposure to stressors without adequate coping mechanisms can lead to mental exhaustion and depression.
                Genetic Factors: Individuals with a family history of depression may be more susceptible to developing stress-induced depression.
                Neurochemical Imbalances: Chronic stress can lead to changes in brain chemistry, particularly the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are associated with mood regulation.
                Trauma: Experiencing traumatic events, whether in childhood or adulthood, can result in stress-related depression.
                Environmental Factors: Unstable living conditions, poor social support, and financial difficulties can contribute to the development of stress depression.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="pragraf">
                ____Emotional Symptoms: Persistent sadness, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, irritability, and anxiety.
                Cognitive Symptoms: Difficulty concentrating, indecisiveness, and memory problems.
                Physical Symptoms: Fatigue, sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia), changes in appetite or weight, and physical pains without a clear medical cause.
                Behavioral Symptoms: Social withdrawal, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, decreased productivity, and increased use of substances like alcohol or drugs.
