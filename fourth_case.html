            ____Overthinking is the process of dwelling excessively on thoughts, often to the point where it hampers decision-making and increases anxiety. 
            It involves repetitive, prolonged thinking about issues or situations, usually focusing on the potential negative outcomes or what could have been done differently. 
            This mental pattern can lead to indecision, stress, and mental fatigue, and may interfere with daily functioning and overall well-being.
